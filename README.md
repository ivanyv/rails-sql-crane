# Rails SQL Crane

Unload common features into pure SQL

I love Rails, but sometimes I miss the times when I used to write raw SQL. Plus, offloading some common tasks/calculations to the DB gives me a warm fuzzy feeling, so I created this repo to collect those bits that I commonly use.

I only work with PostgreSQL so that's what you'll find here. I'm a bit rusty and often try stuff I'm not really familiar with so use caution; not my fault if using code you find here wipes your DB and gets you fired, but PRs welcome ;-)
